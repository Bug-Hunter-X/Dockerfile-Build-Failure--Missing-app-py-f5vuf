This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution. The initial Dockerfile fails to build because the `app.py` file, which is referenced in the `CMD` instruction, is not explicitly included in the build context. The improved Dockerfile explicitly copies the file and uses a more specific path, fixing the issue. This improved example provides more robust error handling and clarity.
